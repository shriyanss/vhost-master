## Usage
```
Usage: cat subdomains.txt | vhost_master
```

## Example
Suppose you have a list of subdomains and you want to get the IP addresses, on which VHost fuzzing can be done. Assuming the subdomains file to be `subdomains.txt`, you'll run the following command:-
```
cat subdomains.txt | vhost_master
```

If you just want to print IP addresses and not other messages, you can use the following command:-
```
cat subdomains.txt | vhost_master -s
```
